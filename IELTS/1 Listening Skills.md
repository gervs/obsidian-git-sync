	- Selection from a list
		- The questions in the Listening paper are in the same order as the information you hear. However, in questions where you have to choose an option from a list, the list of possible options will be in random order.
		- Pay attention to any negatives in the options, as well as any adjectices. The question will tell you how many answers you have to choose, as well as what you need to listen for (e.g. problems, solutions, advantagers, etc.)
